# Super GNT4 Public Issue Tracker

Hi, thanks for taking the time to come and report an issue!

This issue tracker is for both bugs and feature requests. A bug in this case is something unintentional occurring that needs to be fixed. A feature is something you would like the game to do. To ensure your issue can be addressed please follow the issue template and provide all the steps you can so we know exactly how to recreate it. The easier it is to recreate, the easier it is for it to be addressed (usually anyway :D).

Create a Github account and click on the **Issues** tab above or just click [here](https://github.com/Super-GNT4/Super-GNT4-Super-GNT4-Public-Issue-Tracker/issues).
